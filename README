LIFELINE, the ULiège program for the simulation of the X-ray LIne proFiles in
massivE coLliding wInd biNariEs which is designed to compute the profile of emission 
lines emitted in X-rays in the colliding wind region of massive stars binaries. It 
was developed as programmable, interactive tool for studying the physics of the winds 
in binary systems, the emission of X-ray lines and the comparison with the observations. 

LIFELINE is written entirely in python and is intended to be portable across most Unix
operating systems. LIFELINE requires python v2.7, its pyatomdb package and, optionally, the 
ATOMDB database. 

This program was developed by the Enmanuelle Mossoux at the University of Liège (Belgium) 
under the XMM PRODEX contract (Belspo), from the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique (FRS/FNRS).
