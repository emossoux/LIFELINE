/PATH/TO/LIFELINE #Path where to create the directory to save the results in it. This directory must contain the cross section file 'cross_section.tab', the "cooling_functions" directory, the param file and optionally the ionisation fraction file 'ionisation_fraction.tab' if it is already computed (crea_ion_file='no').

1 #What do you want to compute? [1/2/3] 1 - The overall computation, i.e., the velocity distribution, the shock characteristics and the associated line profile; 2 - The shock characteristics for a different inclination or phase and the associated line profile using velocity distribution already computed; 3 - Only the line profile for an ion which is not already computed using the shock characteristics computed for the set of systems.
