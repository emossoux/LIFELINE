/PATH/TO/LIFELINE #Path where to create the directory to save the results in it. This directory must contain the cross section file 'cross_section.tab', the "cooling_functions" directory, the param file and optionally the ionisation fraction file 'ionisation_fraction.tab' if it is already computed (crea_ion_file='no').
stellar_params.txt #File containing the stellar parameters
0 #Index of the first binary to compute (begins at 0). Default value: 0.
1 #Number of binaries to compute. Default value: the length of the stellar parameters file.
1 #What do you want to compute? [1/2/3] 1 - The overall computation, i.e., the velocity distribution, the shock characteristics and the associated line profile; 2 - The shock characteristics for a different inclination or phase and the associated line profile using velocity distribution already computed; 3 - Only the line profile for an ion which is not already computed using the shock characteristics computed for the set of systems.

1.0 #Parameter of the beta law of the wind velocity for star 2. Default value: 1.
100 #Number of bin in the line profile. Default value: 100. Only if mode=1 or 2.
30 #Number of points to discretize the 2D shock between up to opening angle. Default value: 30. Only if mode=1 or 2.
50 #Number of points to discretize the 3D shock (Default value: 50). This will define the angular step between 0 and 2 pi. Only if mode=1 or 2.
20 #Number of points to discretize the width of each side of the shock. Default value: 20. Only if mode=1 or 2.
